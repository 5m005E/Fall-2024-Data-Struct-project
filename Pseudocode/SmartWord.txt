"guesses" string array (length:3): initialize SmartWord with a file of English words

Class constructor:
    initialize SmartWord with a file of English words

"processOldMessages" void function:
    process old messages from oldMessageFile...
    Try initializing a buffered reader to the old message file. 
    While the next line in the file exists:
        Initialize an array of strings resulting from splitting the current line. For 
        each string in the string array, initialize a string by 'cleaning' the current 
        string (temp). Add that string to the 'old messages' array list. If the hasher's 
        hashmap of vocab words doesn't contain that particular key, add it to the hash 
        map along with its new value. Hash the old messages.

"guess" string[] function:
    based on a letter typed in by the user, return 3 word guesses in an array
        letter: letter typed in by the user
        letterPosition:  position of the letter in the word, starts from 0
        wordPosition: position of the word in a message, starts from 0


"feedback" void function:
    feedback on the 3 guesses from the user
	isCorrectGuess: true if one of the guesses is correct
	correctWord: 3 cases:
        a.  correct word if one of the guesses is correct
        b.  null if none of the guesses is correct, before the user has typed in 
                the last letter
        c.  correct word if none of the guesses is correct, and the user has 
                typed in the last letter
	That is:
        Case       isCorrectGuess      correctWord   
        a.         true                correct word
        b.         false               null
        c.         false               correct word
