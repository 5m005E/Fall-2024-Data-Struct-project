function exValKeys():
    init String array for later output

    init 'relevant vocab' hash map using
    hasher 'relevantHash()' method.

    init min heap priority queue to store the
    probability values of the 3 most likely
    words.

    for each entry in the entry set of relevant
    vocab; offer the current entry to the min
    heap priority queue. If the size of the
    priority queue is greater than 3, poll
    the queue (remove smallest element).

    for each index in the string array; poll
    the smallest element from the queue to the
    string array's current index.

    return the array.
