function exValKeys():
    init String array of keys corresponding to the
    best guesses to output (top expected value keys).

    Add the vocab trie to the hasher object.

    Init hash map of relevant words and their
    corresponding likelihoods of being the correct
    guesses.

    Init storage min-heap priority queue for sorting
    guesses for later output.

    for each entry in the entry set of relevant hashed
    words; offer the current entry to the min heap. If
    the min heap size exceeds 3 (number of total guesses),
    poll the queue.

    for index i in the top expected value keys array, set
    element at index i as the key from polling the queue.

    return the top expected value keys.
